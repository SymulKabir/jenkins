## Overview

This repository aims to codify automation around Jenkins — including pipeline setups, scheduling, integration with GitHub, Docker-based CI/CD, and remote deployment via SSH.  
It helps standardize and version control your CI/CD workflows.

## Repository Structure

Below is a general outline of key folders/files (adjust as needed):
```bash
├── docker-cicd/ # Docker-related CI/CD pipeline configs
├── nodeJS-cicd/ # Node.js specific Jenkins pipeline examples
├── ssh-with-remote-server/ # Scripts & pipeline definitions for SSH deployments
├── cicd-automation-schedule/ # Cron-like / scheduled automation pipeline code
├── cicd-automation-with-github/ # Pipeline code integrated with GitHub events
├── README.md # (this file)
└── … # other pipeline / config files
```

You may also find:
- `Jenkinsfile` or groovy scripts for pipeline definition  
- Shell scripts (.sh) to orchestrate builds or deployments  
- Configuration templates (e.g. for credentials, secrets, environment variables)

## Getting Started

These steps will get you a local / development setup to test and run pipelines.

### Prerequisites

- Jenkins server (version compatible)  
- Required plugins installed (Git, SSH, Pipeline, etc.)  
- Docker (if any of pipelines use Docker)  
- Access credentials (SSH keys, secrets, GitHub token, etc.)

### Installation / Setup

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SymulKabir/jenkins.git
    cd jenkins
    ```

2. Copy or configure any secrets / credential files (e.g. `credentials.template`)  
3. Import or configure Jenkins pipelines via “Pipeline from SCM” pointing to this repo  
4. Adjust any environment-specific variables (e.g. hostnames, ports)  

## Usage

Below are common workflows or use cases:

| Scenario | Description |
|---|---|
| **On-push CI** | When code is pushed to master (or branch), Jenkins triggers a build, test, lint, and deployment steps |
| **Scheduled automation** | Jenkins triggers periodic tasks or jobs (e.g. nightly builds) |
| **Docker-based builds** | Builds run inside Docker containers to ensure reproducibility |
| **Remote deploy via SSH** | After successful CI, code is deployed to a remote server over SSH |

Example pipeline snippet (in `Jenkinsfile`):

```groovy
pipeline {
  agent any
  stages {
    stage('Checkout') {
      steps {
        checkout scm
      }
    }
    stage('Build & Test') {
      steps {
        sh 'npm install'
        sh 'npm test'
      }
    }
    stage('Deploy') {
      steps {
        sshagent(['my-ssh-cred']) {
          sh 'scp build/* user@remote:/var/www/app'
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

```


# Configuration & Environment

You may need to set or override the following environment variables or Jenkins credentials:

| Name               | Purpose                               | Example                  |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| SSH_CREDENTIALS_ID | Jenkins credential containing SSH key | ssh-deploy-key           |
| REMOTE_HOST        | Target server to deploy               | myserver.example.com     |
| DOCKER_REGISTRY    | Docker registry URL for pushing images| registry.example.com     |
| NODE_VERSION       | Node.js version to use in build       | 16.x                     |

Make sure these are defined in either Jenkins global credentials, folder/organization settings, or pipeline-level parameters.
